# OOP_PHP_SQL_product_display

My project to display items from a catalogue using OOP PHP and mySQL
to create a restful API.
The user can view the collection of items and also add a new item
which will have attributes defined by the parent class as well as
a unique attribute based on the type of item, which will be present in the newly
created object, for example
if the type is 'DVD' there will be a file size attriute in MBs, or if the
item were a piece of furniture it would dispay it's dimensions.
